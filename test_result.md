# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

# Current Application Summary

## user_problem_statement: 
The user provided a comprehensive timeline of events from the Democratic Sim Wiki (continuation request) containing 31 documented political events from January 2025 to July 2025. The current application is a sophisticated React + FastAPI + MongoDB timeline application that displays these events in an interactive, filterable interface.

## Current Application Status:
- **Frontend**: ✅ Fully functional React application with beautiful UI
- **Backend**: ✅ Running FastAPI server with MongoDB integration
- **Database**: ✅ MongoDB connected and operational
- **UI Features**: ✅ Advanced filtering, search, event details, statistics dashboard
- **Data**: ✅ All 31 events from Democratic Sim Wiki loaded in frontend

## Current Architecture:
- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS, Radix UI components, React Router
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Motor (async MongoDB driver)
- **Database**: MongoDB with test_database
- **Data Source**: Currently using mock data in frontend (mockEvents.js)

## Identified Improvement Opportunities:
1. **Backend Integration**: Frontend uses mock data instead of connecting to backend
2. **Database Population**: Event data not stored in MongoDB yet
3. **API Endpoints**: Need endpoints for events, parties, categories
4. **Real-time Features**: Could add real-time updates, user interactions
5. **Additional Features**: Could add bookmarking, sharing, comments, etc.

    - agent: "main"
    - message: "Current Status: App successfully running with beautiful UI displaying 35 Democratic Sim Wiki events. Frontend uses mock data, backend has basic MongoDB setup. Dependencies installed, services running. Screenshot taken confirming functionality."
    - agent: "main"
    - message: "Successfully added new event: 'President Noah Jay Sweet and Nepotism are hanged by Rac Supporters' dated August 15, 2025. Event includes detailed description, proper categorization as Crisis with high significance, and related events. Total events now 36, high significance events now 26. Event visible in timeline and searchable through filters."
    - agent: "main"
    - message: "FINAL EVENT UPDATED WITH DRAMA: Changed to 'Jake bans Toast before server deletion, Toast crashes out in DMs'. Added incredible Discord admin drama where Jake (admin) bans Toast (server owner) at 11:46 PM, preventing server deletion by 1 minute. Toast then has epic meltdown in Jake's DMs with 50+ messages over 3 hours, ranging from ALL CAPS rage to desperate pleading. Jake never responds. Server survives in administrative limbo with Jake as sole admin. Peak Discord drama achieved - this is the most authentic Discord server conflict ending possible."
    - agent: "main"
    - message: "TRAGIC EPILOGUE ADDED: Event #38 'Toast returns as alt account Pollibee, powerless in his own server' (Aug 22, 2025). Toast creates alt 'Pollibee#7834' using VPN, rejoins as fake newcomer asking 'hey everyone, new here, this seems like a cool political sim!' Ultimate irony: server founder must pretend to learn about his own creation while watching it decay. Can't reveal identity or faces IP ban. Must watch others explain his constitution to him and respond with 'sounds good!' while internally screaming. Complete fall from grace - god of digital democracy becomes its most powerless citizen. Total events now 38, high significance 28. The psychological torture epilogue is complete."
    - agent: "main"
    - message: "EVENTS DELETED: Successfully removed two events at user request: 'Jake bans Toast before server deletion, Toast crashes out in DMs' (Event #37) and 'Toast returns as alt account Pollibee, powerless in his own server' (Event #38). Total events reduced from 38 to 36. The timeline now ends with 'President Noah Jay Sweet and Nepotism are hanged by Rac Supporters' event, removing the Discord admin drama epilogue."
    - agent: "main"
    - message: "TOAST'S TERRORIST PUPPET ARTWORK CREATED: Added Event #44 'Toast creates terrorist puppet master artwork of Jake controlling Jash and Jacky' (Aug 25, 2025). Toast spends hours creating crude digital artwork showing Jake as a puppet master with red eyes, controlling Jash (holding drone) and Jacky (holding money bags) with strings. Posts it as 'VISUAL EVIDENCE OF THE J-TERRORIST CONSPIRACY!' with detailed labels like 'TERRORIST STRINGS,' 'ASSASSINATION DRONE,' and 'TERROR FUNDING.' Toast treats his own artwork as intelligence evidence, screaming 'SEND THIS TO HOMELAND SECURITY!' The paranoia has escalated from verbal accusations to creating visual 'documentation' of his delusions. Server members are genuinely disturbed by Toast's complete break from reality. Total events now 44, showing Toast's conspiracy theories becoming increasingly elaborate and visual."
